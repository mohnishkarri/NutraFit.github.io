        <p>
			<b> Nutrition and Fitness is a website that offers credible information to help you make healthful eating choices with information on exercises.</b> It serves as a gateway to reliable information on nutrition, healthy eating, physical activity, and food safety for consumers. The site is updated on an ongoing basis by a staff of Registered Dietitians at the Food and Nutrition Information Center (FNIC) located at the National Agricultural Library (NAL), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The website receives content guidance from a working group that consists of scientific experts in food and nutrition within USDA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
        </p>
        <p>
            Nutrition.gov was launched in 2004 as part of the USDA's Obesity Intervention Plan. It is funded by the Research, Education and Economics (REE) mission area of USDA.

        </p>
        <p>

            Advertisements, Products, and Services - The goal of Nutrition.gov is to connect consumers with credible nutrition information that is consistent with current science and the most recent edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Education must be the primary intent, rather than persuasion, conversion, or sales. Advertisements for products and services should be minimal and clearly differentiated from the information content. They should not detract from or conflict with web content. Content must provide an aspect of nutrition that is accurate, substantive, unique, credible and objective.
        </p>

            <br>1)Graphics and Layout: Graphics, illustrations and other multimedia designs should enhance the site and load within a reasonable length of time. They should not distract the user or substitute for content.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>2)Software and Hardware: The site should incorporate appropriate use of graphics, audio and/or video. If use of special plug-ins or programs is required they must be available on the site with clear and easy instructions.<br>
