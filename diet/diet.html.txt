<h1> Perfect Balanced Diet Chart With Fruits and vegetables </h1>
<br>
<br>

<p1>At least forty percent of your nutritional intake everyday has to be through fruits and vegetables .
 It is ideal to ensure that every meal includes a colourful assortment of veggies and fruits,
 but if this is difficult to implement you could cover it over the span of a week.
 By doing this each day, you get an adequate supply of vitamins, minerals, potassium, folate,
antioxidants and so on, without compromising on quantity or quality. . </p1>

<h2> Perfect Balanced Diet Chart With Protein </h2>

<br>
<br>
 

<p2>Twenty five percent of your daily nutritional intake should ideally come from healthy proteins found naturally (no shakes or powders please!).
 To begin with, let’s understand the TEF or Thermic Effect of Food, which is caused when you eat. 
The body uses its extra calories to process and digest this food. Of all the food groups, protein contains the highest TEF, 
potentially bringing it up to a whopping 30 percent, which is ten times more than the maximum of 3 per cent that fats offer.
 Protein is also a filling option, particularly animal sources of protein, so this prevents binge fests on unhealthy offerings, 
and makes sure your tummy feels satisfied in a good way. Protein is also a key nutrient in muscle-building, so when you take in a protein-rich diet,
 it helps convert fat to muscle, which in turn increases metabolism. So you’ll eat less, burn more, and stay strong – a win-win situation from every angle.

<h3> Perfect Balanced Diet Chart With Carbohydrates </h3>

<br>
<br>


<p3>Carbs are not on anyone’s radar these days, with most people cutting them out entirely!
 But these are important because they’re your energy source. 
There are three kinds of carbs – sugars, starches and fibre. 
Common sense decrees that you cut down the sugars (unless they occur naturally in fruits, honey, etc), 
eat starches in moderation, and consume fibre as much as possible! Choose whole grains like oatmeal, buckwheat, quinoa, barley, rye and so on, 
which are an important source of B vitamins and complex carbohydrates that keep your energy levels going. These are also rich in fibre and increase your metabolic levels.
 They lower blood sugar levels, and also keep the gut cleansed and in good shape. Want a healthy carb-based lunch? Watch this video for a healthy quinoa biryani recipe!</p3>

<h4> Perfect Balanced Diet Chart With Fats </h4>

<br>
<br>


<p4>While fats have got a bad rep in diet circles, 
it’s important to understand that they’re an essential component to help the body store energy, and use up nutrients. 
They’re great for overall bone, muscle and skin health. But you also have to remember that not all fats are good; 
likewise not everything is poison. Fats are micronutrients, with each molecule being made of one glycerol molecule and three fatty acids.
 These can be either saturated, monosaturated, or polysaturated, depending on the number of double bonds. 
Trans fats are not found in nature, and are a separate category altogether. </p4>

<h5>Saturated fats</h5>


<br>
<br>

<p5> These are fats with no double bonds, which means all carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen atoms.
 Foods rich in saturated fats include fatty meat, full-fat dairy, coconut and coconut oil, palm oil and so on.
 While scientists have found a link between heart trouble and an increased intake of saturated fat, there is still no concrete evidence that this is the cause.
 The key benefit of saturated fats is that they are great for cooking. Because they have no double bonds, they are resistant to heat damage.
 So whether it is frying or any other method of cooking that involves high heat, you needn’t worry about this component if you’re using saturated fats.

<h6> UNSaturated fats </h6>

<br>
<br>

<p6> These are the healthiest fats on the market, divided into two types – monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.
 Monounsaturated fats have one double bond, and are found in nature in olive oil, Avocados, nuts and seeds. 
They boost energy levels, aid weight loss, reduce heart disease and decrease stomach inflammation. 
They aid metabolic syndrome, help reduce blood cholesterol and triglycerides, lower blood pressure, benefit people with type 2 diabetes, and can even reduce cancers like prostrate cancer,
 breast cancer and so on.
 Generally, foods that contain monounsaturated fats like olive oil are liquid at room temperature, while those that contain saturated fats like butter, are solid at room temperature.
 Get your intake through a handful of nuts and seeds each day – cashews, almonds, peanuts, pistachios, olives, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and so on. 
Eggs are another great source of monounsaturated fats, so is pork.

With polysaturated fats, the molecules, as the name suggests, possess two double bonds. Seafood – especially fatty fish – is one of the richest sources. 
If you’re vegetarian, opt for peanut oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, unsweetened peanut butter, canola oil, walnuts, sesame seeds, seaweed and even whole grain wheat. 
Omega 3 fatty acids and Omega 6 fatty acids are found in polyunsaturated fats in large amounts, which are a vital component of skin health, bone health, heart health and neurological disorders.

<h8> What foods should I avoid for a balanced diet? </h8>
<br>
<p8> Most of this is common sense! Foods you should avoid obviously include low-nutrient and high-fat foods – sugar-rich desserts and sugary sweets,
 deep-fried foods, alcohol, packaged foods, foods rich in trans fats, refined grains, excessive red meat intake, 
excessive salt intake and so on.</p8>

<br>
<br>


<h9> What foods should I avoid for a balanced diet? </h9> 
<p9> Water is often overlooked because it contains no real nutrients. But when you drink enough water, you’re hydrating, 
and removing byproducts of fat from your system. It is a great metabolism booster, keeps kidney health in check,
keeps ailments like Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) at bay and reduces the risk of kidney stones. 
It balances digestive health, maintains heart health and keeps acid reflux at bay by neutralising the pH balance in the body.
 Colds and coughs, allergies like asthma and other dust and food-related allergies can also be kept at bay.
 The average Indian woman ideally needs to consume 2.5-3 litres of water a day.  </p9>

<br>
<br>


<h10> What else can I do to supplement a balanced diet? </h10> 
<br>
<p10> A balanced diet needs to be supplemented with a healthy lifestyle for it to be truly effective. 
So start easing off the stress,
 get 7-8 hours of sleep a day, eat on time, and most importantly – get enough exercise into your schedule.    </p10>
